This is the public abstract of project "Investigation into the Performance Enhancement and Configration Paradigm of Partially Integrated RL-MPC System", whose source code will be released after the review passes the public. 
Abstract:
Research on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with control theory has consistently been a focal point of interdisci-plinary interaction. In this context, this paper introduces Deep Deterministic pol-icy gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) methods. Within this framework, the decision-making role of the RL agent is applied to the feedback correction section of the traditional MPC prediction model, jointly refining the prediction model. This method employs a partial integration approach to create a hybrid system, which differs from the traditional method of directly re-placing the prediction model. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through trajectory tracking simulation experiments and real-world experiments in outer loop speed direction control. Furthermore, this paper engages in a comparative discussion regarding its decoupling paradigm and continuous paradigm. It demonstrates that, compared to traditional prediction models, the TD3 method utilizing the decoupling configuration paradigm offers significant advantages in control performance.
